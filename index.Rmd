## General Info

My name is Kacper Nojszewski, I am a student at Military University of
Technology in Warsaw and once I complete my course I will have engineering degree in computer science. The sole purpose of this website is to teach myself R markdown and Git but you can find here some infomration about me like my CV or some projects that i created. I plan to expand this website more in the future but for now thats all.
